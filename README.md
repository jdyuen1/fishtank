Fish Tank was the term project for IAT 265: Multimedia Programming for Arts and Design. This project was developed over the course of 4 months, through multiple iterations and phases. Fish Tank is a simulation of an ocean inhabited by sharks, fish, and seaweed. As both animals get hungry, they navigate through their enviornment in search for food.
